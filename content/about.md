Hi, I'm Simon. Welcome to my personal website! 

I studied pure mathematics at UT Austin and graduated in Fall 2023. During undergrad, I went deep into theoretical mathematics with an eye toward topology and geometry. I was particularly drawn to topics like *TQFTs* and *low-dimensional topology*, which raise deep questions at the intersection of algebraic topology, mathematical physics, and differential geometry.

At some point, I got interested in how mathematical thinking could be applied beyond pure theory. This led me to explore areas like statistics, machine learning, and *quantum information*. My coursework ranged from *measure-theoretic probability* to *neural networks* and algorithms.

After graduating, I spent a little less than a year working as a quantitative researcher at a small quant shop called **North Cut Trading**. There, I developed systematic trading strategies, ran regressions, and optimized portfolios.

Lately, I‚Äôve been spending more time on computer science and machine learning. If you want to chat about math, CS, or interesting problems in general, feel free to [reach out](mailto:simonxiang@utexas.edu)!

## Personal
- In college, I did a lot of triathlon training. Since the city I live in now isn't conducive to this, I play a lot of table tennis nowadays.
- I like Linux --- I [daily drove Arch Linux](https://github.com/simonxiang1/dotfiles) for ~2 years. While I now use MacOS, I'm still a `vim` fiend.
- Recently, I rekindled my old hobby of learning Japanese after discovering a nice tool called [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io). This prompted me to create my [KKLC Lookup](https://kanji.simonxiang.xyz) project, as the default mnemonics were ... not good.
- I enjoy a good latte ‚òï and matcha üçµ.
