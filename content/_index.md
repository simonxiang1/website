# Simon Xiang

Welcome to my personal website! I graduated from UT Austin in Fall 2023 with a degree in pure mathematics. Formerly, I worked as a quant researcher at a small startup.

I'm interested in pure mathematics, machine learning, and software engineering, especially where theory meets practice.

## Projects
- [**Rademacher Complexity** (*Python, Streamlit*)](https://rademacher-complexity.streamlit.app/): Interactive visualization of Rademacher Complexity bounds, showcasing a day in my life as a quant researcher.
- [**Math Notes** (*LaTeX*)](https://github.com/simonxiang1/math_notes): A collection of live-TeXed notes I took as an undergrad, spanning topics from algebraic topology to TQFTs.
- [**Kanji Lookup** (*Python, Gemini 2.0 Flash, HTML/CSS, JS*)](https://kanji.simonxiang.xyz): A quick kanji lookup tool for the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course (KKLC), featuring OCR-powered mnemonics and smart search.
- [**Dotfiles** (*Linux*)](https://github.com/simonxiang1/dotfiles): Configuration files for my Arch Linux setup. Although I daily drive MacOS now, some dotfiles are still in usage.
