Sadly school got in the way. I’ve seen people post what they’ve been learning online, not so much as something that others would be interested in, but rather as a time capsule and reflection of sorts. Which seemed like a mighty fine idea, hence this post. Here’s what I’ve been studying over Thanksgiving break (more loosely, somewhat recently), now that I have no tedious homework or essays to write. The main topic was algebraic topology, as always.<h3 id=category-theory>Category Theory</h3><p>As the title suggests, I’ve been brushing up on some category theory.<ul><li>Specifically, I added some constructions to my list of examples like the homotopy category $\mathsf{hTop}$ and the chain complex functors and algebraic homology functor, the latter two when composed assign a sequence of abelian homology groups to a space.<li>The biggest development was wrapping my head around <strong>products</strong> and <strong>coproducts</strong> of categories. These satisfy <em>universal properties</em>, that is, when they exist relative to some morphisms, they’re unique. Coproducts are the dual categorical construction of products by reversing the arrows, they take inclusion maps into a space uniquely, the set theoretic example being the disjoint union. We can also generalize these to more than two objects by means of <strong>cones</strong> and <strong>cocones</strong>, and later on limits and colimits.<li>I reviewed what <strong>monomorphisms</strong> and <strong>epimorphisms</strong> were, and realized the boundary maps $H_n(X,A)\overset{\partial}{\longrightarrow}H_{n-1}(A)$ and the the change-of-coefficient homomorphisms $H_n(X;G_1)\to H_n(X;G_2)$ as natural transformations.<li>If I have time, I plan on learning about the Yoneda lemma, limits and colimits, pullbacks and pushouts, and abelian categories.</ul><h3 id=algebraic-topology>Algebraic Topology</h3><p>Everything I learn is to aid my study of algebraic topology, of course, but here is the pure algebraic topology concepts I covered. The big development was reveiwing shaky foundations, including<ul><li><strong>Cell complexes.</strong> Hatcher’s exposition was way too dense for me at the beginning of the semester, but now that I’ve matured a little I revisited it in depth and it actually makes a lot of sense. The general idea of building complexes by attaching higher dimensional cells is intuitive (and worked somewhat for most of the semester), but I finally worked out the details of the structure of attaching maps and cells. Specifically, forming the $n$-skeleton $X^n$ from $X^{n-1}$ by attaching $n$-cells $e_{\alpha}^n$ via maps $\varphi_{\alpha} \colon S^{n-1} \to X^{n-1}$, where $X^n=X^{n-1}\amalg_{\alpha}D_{\alpha}^n/\sim$ and $\sim$ is the relation $x\sim \varphi_{\alpha}(x)$ for $x\in \partial D_{\alpha}^n=S^{n-1}$ to get $X^n=X^{n-1}\amalg_{\alpha}e_{\alpha}^n$ made no sense to me. So I worked out examples with $n=1,2,3$ in detail, which illuminated the attaching formula significantly.<li>There were also portions of general CW theory that I missed, like what a <strong>characteristic map</strong> was, and the formal definitions of a <strong>subcomplex</strong> and <strong>CW pairs</strong>.<li>I covered the constructions you can do with CW complexes in depth. For example: <ul><li><strong>Products:</strong> Essentially the complex with product cells ranging over the base complexes.<li><strong>Quotients:</strong> These take a CW pair $(X,A)$ and smoosh $A$ down to a point (or $0$-cell).<li><strong>Suspension:</strong> An important yet seemingly weird construction, build from two <strong>cones</strong>, defined as the quotient $(X\times I)/(X\times {0})$ to a point. For example, the suspension of the circle $S^1$ looks like a two-sided top.<li><strong>Join:</strong> This joins two spaces $X$ and $Y$ by line segments between points, formally $X\times Y\times I/\sim$ with the relation $(x,y_1,0)\sim(x,y_2,0)$ and $(x_1,y,1)\sim(x_2,y,1)$. This is a particularly confusing construction, so I worked out several examples in detail. You can also view a <strong>simplex</strong> as an iterated join of points.<li><strong>Wedge Sum:</strong> This fundamental construction is made by identifying two spaces together at a point. For example, $S^1\vee S^1$ is the figure eight, $S^1\vee S^1\vee S^1$ is the fidget spinner, and a wedge sum of $n$ circles is the $n$-bouquet. A neat fact is that for any complex, the quotient $X^n/X^{n-1}$ is the wedge sum of $n$-spheres $\bigvee_{\alpha}S_{\alpha}^n$, since collapsing the previous structure to a point leaves us with a bunch of $n$-cells joined at a $0$-cell, precisely the wedge sum of $n$-spheres.<li><strong>Smash Product:</strong> This is a construction I have never used before, to be honest. Its the quotient of the product by collapsing the wedge sum, or $(X\times Y)/(X\vee Y)$. You can think of it as deleting overlapping structure of the product. It makes a lot more sense with examples, some of them being: <ul><li>The smash product of two circles $S^1\wedge S^1$ is the torus $\mathbb T$ quotient the figure eight, which can the thought of simultaneously contracting the inner ring and an outer ring, so the resulting structure is the simply-connected $2$-sphere $S^2$.<li>Smashing any space $X$ and the two point sphere $S^0$ results in $X$, because $X\times S^0$ is simply two copies of $X$, and you identify a copy of $X$ to a point in the other copy of $X$, which is just $X$ again.<li>To generalize the first example, the smash product of an $n$-sphere and an $m$-sphere is the $(n+m)$-sphere, or $S^n\wedge S^m=S^{n+m}.$ To see why, the product CW structure has four cells, a zero cell, an $n$-cell, an $m$-cell, and an $(n+m)$-cell. The wedge sum wedges everything but the $(n+m)$-cell together, and collapsing that to a point yields an $(n+m)$-cell plus a $0$-cell, which is precisely $S^{n+m}$.</ul></ul><li>We also have that collapsing a contractible subcomplex to a point preserves homotopy type, which can be used to show that finite connected graphs look like wedges of $S^1$, and $S^2/S^0$ and $S^1\vee S^2$ are homotopy equivalent.<li>I also reviewed the <strong>Euler characteristic</strong> $\chi(X)$ defined by even cells minus odd cells, or formally $\chi(X)=\sum_{n=0}^k(-1)^nc_n$. With $k=2$, and $0$-cells as vertices, $1$-cells as edges, and $2$-cells as faces, this turns out to be the familiar formula $V-E+F=2$ for convex polyhedra.<li>I did an in depth study of the real projective space $\mathbb R \mathrm P^n$, focusing on how to visualize the realization of $\mathbb R \mathrm P^n$ as the sphere with antipodal points identified, that is, how $\mathbb R\mathrm P^n\cong S^n /(v\sim -v)$. Dealing with lower dimensional cases helped, the general idea is to realize lines as a specific angle in the upper hemisphere, since they go through both and considering two sets of angles would be redundant. Then, we can inductively build $\mathbb R\mathrm P^n$ from $\mathbb R \mathrm P^0,\mathbb R \mathrm P^1$, etc by giving $\mathbb R \mathrm P^n$ a CW structure, which turns out to be one $n$-cell for each dimension. That is, $\mathbb R \mathrm P^0=e^0\cup e^1\cup \cdots \cup e^n$.<li>I also covered the complex projective space $\mathbb C \mathrm P^n$, and how it has a CW structure $\mathbb C\mathrm P^n=e^0\cup e^2\cup \cdots \cup e^{2n}$. Something I would like to understand better is how exactly we visualize the construction of $\mathbb R \mathrm P^2$ and $\mathbb C \mathrm P^1$, since these immerse in $\mathbb R^3$ (Boy’s surface), but how exactly the immersions were constructed is unclear to me.<li>Since we’re going to talk about homotopy theory next week, I read a little bit about the higher homotopy groups of spheres in Hatcher, and started to define the higher homotopy groups.<li>Finally, I began reviewing basic fundamental concepts like the fundamental group (haha), and the fact that $\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb Z$, since I didn’t understand that proof the first time around. I also plan on reviewing basic covering space theory.</ul><h3 id=group-theory>Group Theory</h3><p>Before UT, I thought I knew everything there was to know about groups. This turned out to be a horribly misinformed perception of reality.<ul><li>To complement the study of products in category theory, I studied the <strong>direct product</strong> in depth. There’s more to it than “addition componentwise”, it turns out if you have two normal subgroups $H,K\trianglelefteq G$ where you can write every $g\in G$ uniquely as a product $hk$ for $h\in H$ and $k\in K$, and $H,K$ have trivial intersection, then the amazing fact follows that $G$ must be isomorphic to the product $H\times K$!<li>Now I’m working on wrapping my head around the <strong>semidirect product</strong>, a generalization of the direct product by relaxing the normality of one of the subgroups. This means we have to consider the action induced by a homomorphism into the automorphism group of the normal subgroup, to defined the product as $(h_1,k_1)(h_2,k_2)=(h_1k_1\cdot h_2,k_1,k_2)$ (where $\cdot$ denotes the left action of the homomorphism $\varphi$). This is a generalization because if $\varphi$ is the trivial homomorphism the operation simply becomes the same as componentwise multiplication.<li>I also reviewed the idea of <strong>free abelian groups</strong>, which are defined in a linear algebraic fashion but turn out to be isomorphic to copies of $\mathbb Z$, which I proved as an exercise. Furthermore, they have a <em>basis</em> that generates the group, and every basis has the same amount of elements.<li>If I have time, I plan on completing the proof of the <strong>fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups</strong>, something I have been interested in since my first abstract algebra course. The theorem says that every finitely generated abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to copies of $\mathbb Z$ mod prime power (nonunique), plus copies of the infinite cyclic $\mathbb Z$, or more concisely$$ A \simeq \bigoplus_i \mathbb Z_{p_i^{k_i}}\oplus \mathbb Z^n. $$</ul><h3 id=latex>LaTeX</h3><ul><li><p>I cleaned up my preamble a little (removed some comments and failed features)! I also figured out how to defined general theorem and definition environments, for example now I can do cool things like:</p> <p><strong>Zorn’s Lemma:</strong> If every chain in a poset $P$ has an upper bound, then $P$ has a maximal element.</p> <p>in LaTeX! Before, I would have to do something lame like <strong>Lemma</strong> (Zorn). The main purpose was for the number of constructions we can do on CW complexes, but this will certainly come in handly later if I don’t want to define an entire environment for one theorem.</p><li><p>I also cleaned up the structure of my algebraic topology notes. For example, the files used to be called <code>notes_1.tex, notes_2.tex</code>, but now they have the appropiate naming scheme of <code>category_theory.tex, homology.tex</code>, etc.</p></ul><h3 id=planned-learning>Planned Learning</h3><ul><li>Everything mentioned at the end of the sections above, of course.<li>Our complex analysis course never covered things like analytic continuation and what a meromorphic function was, so I’ll probably take some notes on such topics in my free time.<li>I also want to study more linear algebra, since at UNT we didn’t cover very much (as it was a course for engineers). Some topics include reviewing orthogonal and orthonormal bases, learning about inner product spaces, dual spaces, and tensors.<li>Finally, over winter I plan to read chapter 5 of Pugh’s <em>Analysis</em> (the section on multivariate analysis), in preparation for my differential topology and Riemannian geometry courses next semester.</ul><p>Detailed notes on every topic mentioned can be found <a href=https://github.com/simonxiang1/math_notes/blob/master/freshman_year/algebraic_topology/master_notes.pdf rel=noopener target=_blank>here</a> (or more generally, <a href=https://github.com/simonxiang1/math_notes/ rel=noopener target=_blank>here</a>).<p class=tags-data></main><footer><hr><div id=footer-container><div><p>Built with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>Zola</a> using the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/Speyll/anemone target=_blank>anemone</a> theme.</div><div><a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates." class=no-style href=https://simonxiang.xyz/atom.xml target=_blank><svg class=icons><use href=https://simonxiang.xyz/icons.svg#rss></use></svg></a></div></div></footer>
